this another question on finding the winner of circular game  .This is very interest one .
goal:linear time complexity O(n)
apporach : Since our goal is to done the work in linear time .For me whenever linear time complexity loops(iterative method) comes into mind .
so using explaination part i come up with the below code:
hint :counting sort (algo)
class Solution {
    public int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        int result=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
        {
            result=(result+k)%i;
        }
        return result+1;
    }
}
